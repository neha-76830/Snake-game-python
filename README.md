# Snake Game – Python (Pygame)

This is a simple *Snake Game* created using Python and the Pygame library.

In this game, the player controls a snake that moves on the screen and eats food. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows in length, and the score increases. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.

## Game Preview

This is how the Snake Game looks while running:

- The snake is moving using arrow keys
- Food appears as a colored block
- Score increases every time snake eats food
- Game ends when snake hits itself or the wall
